# Enterprise Test Automation Framework for AUT (Salesforce)

## 1. Overview

The enterprise test automation framework is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich solution for automated testing of the Salesforce application (AUT). The framework encompasses various features, including data-driven testing, logging, retry mechanism, self-healing, cross-browser testing, multiple environments, password encryption, code quality, CI/CD integration, reusable utilities, data generation, parallel testing, and API mocking/testing.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Page Object Model (POM) Implementation

- **Objective:** Apply POM Principle to structure the code and make reusable & maintainable code.

### 2.2 Data-Driven Testing

- **Objective:** Enhance test coverage by parameterizing tests with external data.

### 2.3 Logging

- **Objective:** Provide comprehensive logs for detailed test execution analysis.

### 2.4 Retry Mechanism

- **Objective:** Handle intermittent failures gracefully with automatic retries.

### 2.5 Self-Healing

- **Objective:** Adapt to dynamic changes in the Salesforce application to minimize maintenance efforts.

### 2.6 Cross-Browser Testing

- **Objective:** Validate application functionality across different browsers.

### 2.7 Multiple Environments

- **Objective:** Support testing in various environments (e.g., sandbox, developer edition, production).

### 2.8 Password Encryption

- **Objective:** Securely manage and use passwords in test scenarios.

### 2.9 Code Quality

- **Objective:** Enforce coding standards and maintain high-quality code.

### 2.10 CI/CD Integration

- **Objective:** Seamlessly integrate the framework with CI/CD pipelines.

### 2.11 Reusable Utilities

- **Objective:** Develop modular and reusable utilities to optimize code maintenance.

### 2.12 Data Generation

- **Objective:** Generate test data dynamically to ensure diverse test scenarios.

### 2.13 Parallel Testing

- **Objective:** Execute tests concurrently for faster feedback and optimized test suite execution.

### 2.14 API Mocking/Testing

- **Objective:** Mock and test Salesforce APIs to validate backend functionality.
